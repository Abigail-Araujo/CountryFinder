# Country Finder 🌎

## Description ✍🏻

Country Finder is an interactive web application that allows users to search and view basic information about countries using the REST Countries API. The application facilitates searching for countries by name and displays a list of up to 10 matching results, presenting the flag and name of each country.

This project was developed for learning purposes, with the main objective of applying and consolidating knowledge in consuming RESTful APIs and dynamically manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

**Limitations:** To optimize visualization and maintain clarity, the application displays a maximum of 10 results. If the search yields more than 10 matches, the user is prompted to refine their query.

* **CSS:** Visual styles and responsive design.
* **JavaScript:** Application logic, DOM manipulation, and consumption of the REST Countries API.
* **API:** [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) for obtaining detailed country information.

## Features 🔍

* **Intelligent Search:** Allows searching for countries by name, accepting partial and complete matches.
* **Concise Visualization:** Displays a list of up to 10 matching countries, presenting the flag and name of each.
* **Informative Messages:** Provides clear feedback to the user, for example, indicating the need to refine the search if more than 10 results are found.

## Future Improvements 📝

* Implement a details page for each country, displaying additional information when clicking on the flag or name.
